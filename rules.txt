The Lost Forest is an exploration game. It consists of 3 stages, each with its own level of difficulty:
Your journey starts in the forest, where you need to defeat one enemy. 
If you succeed, you get the key for another stage: House.
There you can find something more than enemies, but I would keep it as a secret. You will see as you get there!
If you are lucky enough, you will possess a key for the last part of the game: Cave!
The cave is full of mysteries and darkness. Only those who are strong and wise will become winners! 
Good luck!
